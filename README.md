  **More Details**

  3. Early Fusion Mechanism
     - Initial multiplayer mechanism involving with NetworkObjects, Creating a prototype for lobby
    
  2. Idea Pitching
     - Providing detailed descriptions about the framework, and the pseudocode for the other programmer
  
  **What i learned**
  - I learned more about the learning and research process in tackling a problem as this project was made recently after the new multiplayer framework released. This was way ahead of what our team expected as we were informed that the multiplayer implimentation was easy. Though at that time we did not think through by using another multiplayer framework but to keep on developing the game using bare knowledge none other than the documentation itself. Through reading on the documentation, i developed my reading skills to grasp such knowledge effortlessly. As another plus, my abiltity to analyze and deconstruct the whole idea through testing it makes it much more easier to be discerned.
  - Throughout the project, i learned to communicate with the teammates and also improved problem solving skills mainly program designing to tackle an approach. I learned to do an effective communication with the other programmer, providing him concepts to problems that was a problem for him personally.
